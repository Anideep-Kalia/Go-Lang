
# GoLang Quick Reference Guide 🐹

## 📚 General Concepts

### Null and Nil
- `null` is referred to as `nil` in Go.
- Data type descriptions in Go come **after** the variable name, unlike some other languages.

### No Inheritance
- Go does **not** support inheritance, nor does it have `super` or `parent` keywords.
- Way around:
```
type Animal struct {
    Name string
}

func (a Animal) Speak() {
    fmt.Println("Animal speaking...")
}

type Dog struct {
    Animal // embeds Animal; its methods/fields are *promoted*
}

func (d Dog) Speak() { // overrides the promoted Speak
    fmt.Println("Dog barking...")
}

func main() {
    d := Dog{Animal: Animal{Name: "Bruno"}}

    d.Speak()         // Dog barking...  (Dog’s method wins)
    d.Animal.Speak()  // Animal speaking... (“super” style call)

    // Promoted field access:
    fmt.Println(d.Name) // "Bruno" (from embedded Animal)
}

```

## 📄 File Handling in Go

- You can have multiple files in the same package using the same `main` function. 
- If a conflict occurs, adjust by changing one main function and calling it within another.

---

## 🖨️ Print Functions

- **`fmt.Printf`** requires format specifiers such as `%T` (type) or `%v` (value) to display variables.
- **`fmt.Println`** displays variables directly without requiring format specifiers.

---

## 🔤 Data Types and Strings

- **All input data** in Go is treated as `string`.
- Handling large numbers (64-bit and above) often requires packages like `big.Int` or `big.NewInt`.

---

## 🕒 Date & Time Formatting

```go
time.Now().Format("01-02-2006 15:04:05 Monday")
```

---

## 🛑 Error Handling

- Use the `fmt` package instead of `print` and `panic` for better formatting and error management.

---

## 🧩 Working with Arrays and Slices

- `fruits2[:3]` retrieves the **first 3 elements** of an array.
- Use `make` for creating slices, maps, and channels in Go.

---

## 📦 Maps and Structs

- **Map Declaration Example**:
  ```go
  var myOnlineData map[string]interface{}
  ```
  Here, `interface{}` allows mapping of any data type.

- **Difference in `println` with Structs**:
  - `%v` shows the struct value.
  - `%+v` shows struct fields **and** values.

---

## 🔀 Control Flow

- Go supports the `goto` command to jump between code blocks.
- The `defer` keyword stores the deferred code, executing it in reverse order.

---

## 🚀 Goroutines and Concurrency

- **Goroutines**: Lightweight threads managed by Go runtime for concurrent execution.
- **Example of Starting a Goroutine**:
  ```go
  go functionName()
  ```
- **WaitGroups (`sync.WaitGroup`)**:
  - Use `wg.Add()` to increase thread count.
  - Use `wg.Done()` to decrease it.

---

## 🔗 Channels for Communication

- **Basic Syntax**:
  - Sending data: `ch <- value`
  - Receiving data: `value := <-ch`
- Channels operate like stacks; data is removed after being retrieved.
- Closing a channel disallows further data pushes.
- **Control Concurrency**
  - These are also used to control number of concurrency taking place i.e. number of goroutines working at a time
  - EXAMPLE: 
    - Number of Goroutine is controlled by fixing the size of channel
    - Each goroutine pushes in stack before starting but if the channel is full
    - Then that goroutine has to wait befoer channel is freed; else if the channel has space
    - Then goroutine don't have to wait and can start immediately after pushing into channel

## 📦 Modules and Packages

- **Local Setup**:
  - `go mod init {folder_name}`: Makes the folder's contents available locally.
- **Remote Setup**:
  - `go mod init github.com/username/{folder_name}`: Publishes to GitHub for broader access and Makes the folder's contents available locally.

---

## ✍️ Syntax Quick Reference

### Variables

```go
var {name} int  // Declaration
{name} := value // Short-hand assignment
```

### Maps

```go
{name} := make(map[int]int)
```

### Structs

```go
type User struct{}
```

---
### Packages 

All files in the same folder belong to the same package. You do not need to import files within the same package explicitly.
Example:

```go
project/
├── main.go
├── helpers/
│   ├── math.go
│   ├── string.go
```

- helpers/math.go:
  ```go
  package helpers

  func Add(a, b int) int {
      return a + b
  }
  ```

- helpers/string.go:
  ```go
  package helpers

  func ToUpperCase(s string) string {
      return strings.ToUpper(s)
  }
  ```
- main.go:
  ```go
  package main

  import (
      "project/helpers"
      "fmt"
  )

  func main() {
      fmt.Println(helpers.Add(3, 5))          // Output: 8
      fmt.Println(helpers.ToUpperCase("go")) // Output: GO
  }
  ```

here project is initialised directory during 
```go
  go mod init project
```
but if you used github URL then you would import these folder as
```go
  import (
    "github.com/username/{folder_name}/helpers"
  )
```
above in main folder

---

## Additional Notes 📝

- **Anonymous Functions**: Define and call immediately:
  ```go
  func() { ... }()
  ```
- Ensure **synchronization** when using Goroutines by using WaitGroups, or else the `main` function may exit prematurely.
- Miscellaneous
  ```go
  type DefaultParser struct {
    customField string
  }
  func (d DefaultParser) GetCustomField() string {   // copy of the instance and not actual instance will be changed
    return d.customField
  }
  func (*d DefaultParser) GetCustomField() string {   // actual instance will be modified in this function
    return d.customField
  }
  ```

---

## Receiver

(r *mutationResolver) -> receiver to show that CreateAccount is a method of mutationResolver just like in OOP 
```go
  func (r *mutationResolver) CreateAccount(ctx context.Context, in AccountInput) (*Account, error) {
```
